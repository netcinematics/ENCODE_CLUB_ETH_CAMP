Task 001

Design BLOCKCHAIN from M0n0p0ly perspective.

Thinking about how to have DECENTRIALIZED intermediary.

Without any centralized control.

----

What are the key components required for M0n0p0ly Game to work?

How might people cheat?

----

How are RULES enforced?

How is concensus gained?

How is double-spend protected against?


- thank you Encode Camp for this fun assignment 001.

FIRST CONCEPT: The entire CONCEPT of M0N0P0LY is - CENTRALIZED!

So we RE-IMAGINE the MISSION of DECENTRALIZED-M0N0P0LY. Called... YOURCITY.

# YOURCITY a GIS APP, of $MOCITY BLOCKCHAIN.


----

## CONCEPT: 

Like mixing M0n0p0ly with P0k0m0n G0, with GE0-CACHE, and BLOCKCHAIN! 
Fascinating dynamics to architect. Such a FUN PUZZLE.

"Anyone can buy into any business anywhere." 

"PLOTS", are like nodes on and off the "MARKET" (network).

With innovative modulations LIKE: "Town Marshall". 

In Parallel-Cyber-Ecosystems...(PCE).
With Parallel-Digital-Ownership-System (PDOS).

Trying not to smile, as this sounds fun, realistic, and possible???


## KEY COMPONENTS


"ROLEZ" - MERCHANT, OWNER, RENTER, WORKER, STAKER | STEWARD, MARSHALL, MAYOR, GOVERNOR, M0N0.

"ACTORZ" - take on ROLEZ by ACTIONZ - linked to physical PLOTS in YOURCITY.

- M0N0-OPPRESSOR??? (king??) ... we regress. M0N0? There must be a better WAGMI way: STEWARD?

PLOTZ - are VERIFIED by various GIS interfaces.

YOURCITY - gets better... KEEP READING!

----

## PURPOSE and ROLEZ

BLOCKCHAIN-GAME: based on real world, parrallel cyber ecosystem (for now???).


"A way to own YOURCITY, without owning a single physical item."


It seems like a Parrallel Digital Ownership System (PDOS).

With INCENTIVES for ROLES, based around REAL WORLD PLACES.

Who will be first to own YOUR CITY?

Will YOU be GOVERNOR? MAYOR? MERCHANT? "V0ID" or "M0N0"???

## GUIDING DESIGN-PRINCIPLE: 

Considering.. NEW-CONTEXT.
M0nopoly COMPLETELY RE-IMAGINED. 


With this DESIGN PRINCIPLE: "we try to NOT force a square-peg, of Old M0n0p0ly, into round-hole of - New Web 3!"

So, we THROW OUT ALL RULES and GAME MECHANICS and START from SCRATCH - to LEVERAGE WEB3 ADVANTAGES. 
In other words, M0n0p0ly completely ADAPTED to Web3 - MORPHED -  to (BEST-FIT) adapt with Web3 Technology.

Specifically, GAME-MECHANICS and RULES, ALL ADAPT to Web3 UX needs, NOT the other way around. 

Another FOCUS: to Reboot M0n0p0ly GamePlay, as a SECURE DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM, that PROVIDES FAIR INCENTIVES, LEVERAGE ADVANTAGES, and MITIGATES COMPLEXITY of DECENTRALIZED interactions. 

----

## SMART-CONTRACT in CONTEXT

M0n0p0ly Live is given ERC720 Token (at first) call it $M0.

With a CUSTOM - MUTABLE - SMART CONTRACT.

Consider $M0 to be FREE - no buy in - and default start is 1000$M0.


----

## MOBILE PERSPECTIVE

Because Web3 is highly MOBILE - it has a MOBILE PERSEPECTIVE of GIS.

The "plots" are REAL LIFE LOCATIONS - via GIS resources - on your PHONE.

It can be many APPS... that VIEW the 

INCENTIVE MECHANISMS (below) drive INTERACTION from anyone, anywhere.


## KEY COMPONENTS

Each PLOT has STATE of either FOUND, FOR SALE, or SERVING.

The STATE of PLOT is MUTABLE and needs verified, secure update.

The INTERACTION for each STATE of PLOT is as follows:

- You walk into a BAR...
- BAR is FOR SALE: you can buy it if you have enough $M0.
- BAR is SERVICING: you can GET TOKENZ, which STAKE the BAR...
     you PAY for SERVICE, where FUTURE SERVICE pays you back in Micro$M0.
     the OWNER of BAR is PAID in Macro$M0. 
     Like maybe YOU BUY TOKENZ TO Stake A SPECIFIC BEVERAGE. Etc.
     And For every new person to STAKE BEVERAGE, Macro/Micro distro$M0.
     Deeper GAME-MECHANIC DETAILS with INCENTIVE MECHANISM below.
- BAR is UNKNOWN: incentive provided to DEVELOP/MAINTAIN/UPGRADE PLOT

----

## INCENTIVE MECHANISMS

- incentive to bring PLOT on chain.
- incentive to strike VACANT PLOTS off chain.
- incentive to identify bad actors in the system (marshall).

## HOW ACTORZ can be BADACTORZ

- TOWNMARSHALL TOKENS.


THE~END ~ : )
